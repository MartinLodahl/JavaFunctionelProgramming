The RPN Calculator, works with standard actions (* - / +), 
When you type a string to the calculator, whenever you leave a white space, you're making either a new number or a new action (+ / * -). 
The calculator can't handle if you type anything that isn't a number, nor a +, -, *, or /. 
So if you for instance write a char or just a blank space, it will crash.
